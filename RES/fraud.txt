Slide 2: Introduction

Financial fraud is a growing concern in digital transactions.

Traditional fraud detection methods rely on statistical analysis, but they struggle with evolving fraud tactics.

Machine learning (ML) offers adaptive fraud detection capabilities, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

This research explores ML-based fraud detection within a risk management framework.

Slide 3: Problem Statement

Fraud detection faces challenges due to imbalanced datasets and complex fraud patterns.

Traditional methods like rule-based detection lack adaptability to new fraud techniques.

Machine learning models, especially ensemble methods, improve fraud detection accuracy.

The study focuses on optimizing Random Forest for fraud detection using credit card transaction data.

Slide 4: Methodology

Dataset: Kaggle credit card fraud dataset (284,807 transactions, 492 fraudulent cases).

Model Selection: Comparison of Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.

Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy (AUC score).

Evaluation Metrics: Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, and precision-recall analysis.

Slide 5: Research Gap

Traditional fraud detection methods lack scalability and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns.

Many ML-based models struggle with class imbalance in fraud datasets.

There is a need for optimized ensemble methods that enhance fraud detection in financial transactions.

The study fills this gap by refining Random Forest performance in fraud detection.

Slide 6: Conclusion

Machine learning enhances fraud detection accuracy and efficiency.

Random Forest outperforms traditional models in identifying fraudulent transactions.

Future work will focus on improving real-time fraud detection and addressing dataset imbalance.

The study contributes to the advancement of fraud prevention in financial systems.
