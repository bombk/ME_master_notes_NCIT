Machine learning
1 Data science
  It is the extraction of knowlege from data by using different
  techniques and algorithms
2. Artificial Intelligence
  It is a technique which enables machine to mimic human behaviour.

3. Machine learning 
  It is a subset of AI technique which uses statistical methods to enable machines to
  improved with experience

4. Deep Learnig 
   It is a subset of ML which make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.


1. supervise learning
2. unsupervise learning
3. reinforcement learning

1. Supervise machine learnig
  input and output is already defined.
 some algorithms
 a. Linear regression
 b. Random Forest
 c. Support Vector Machine

2. Unsupervise learning
 input is define output is not defined.This make clustering.
 some algorithms
 a. Apriori algorithm
 b. K-Means Algorithm
 c. Hierarchical Clustering

3. Reinforcement Learning
  it learn machine by feedbacks from users.
